## <insert goal>

## I want to take you on a
# journey

---

## Meet Alex
# 👨‍💻

---

# Alex is a developer

---

## He just started at this
# cool company

^
Let's call them ...

---

# Smallcentrix

---

## They are pretty big on
# Clean Code

---

## He starts working
## on his first project

---

## They tell him to
# write tests

^
No experience doing that

---

# :scream:

---

![](images/no-idea.gif)

---

## Alex asks himself
# Why?

---

> It costs time!

---

> It's annoying!

---

> I can test manually!

---

## But he starts to write tests

---

## <angry typing gif>?

^
This is ...

---

## It's painful

---

## The tests break with the smallest change

---

## They take a lot of time to maintain

---

## They are hard to read

---

## Alex is frustated

---

# <rage.gif>?

---

## A senior developer
## approaches him

> Let's do this together

# Test Pyramid

- A lot of Unit Tests
- Less Integration Tests
- Even less Acceptance/UI Tests
- Some manual tests

![right 100%](images/test-pyramid.png)

---

# Acceptance Tests
## UI Tests

---

# Acceptance/UI Tests

- High-level testing
- Ensure requirements are being fulfilled
- A topic on it's own

^
~10%
Not focussing on this

---

# Integration Tests

---

# Integration Tests

- Test parts working together
- Black box testing
- Does not care about inner workings

^
Relevant, but we'll focus on

---

# Unit Tests

- Test single "units" in isolation
- Independent from each other
- Good unit tests act as ...
  + design specifications
  + documentation

^
You might ask, and Alex does too, ...

---

> What makes a good Unit Test?
-- Alex

---

> First you need to understand how to write testable units.

# Example

---

```python
def get_time_of_day():
  now = datetime.now()

  if now.hour >= 0 and now.hour < 6:
    return "night"
  elif now.hour >= 6 and now.hour < 12:
    return "morning"
  elif now.hour >= 12 and now.hour < 18:
    return "afternoon"

  return "evening"
```

---

> Do you see any issues with this code?
-- 🧙‍♂️

---

```python
def get_time_of_day():
  now = datetime.now()

  if now.hour >= 0 and now.hour < 6:
    return "night"
  elif now.hour >= 6 and now.hour < 12:
    return "morning"
  elif now.hour >= 12 and now.hour < 18:
    return "afternoon"

  return "evening"
```

---

> How might a test for this function look like?
-- 🧙‍♂️

---

```python




class TestGetTimeOfDay(unittest.TestCase):
  def test_returns_morning_at_6am(self):
    # How to specify 6am?
    self.assertEqual(get_time_of_day(), "morning")
```

-- 🧙‍♂️

---

```python
def get_time_of_day():
  now = datetime.now()

  if now.hour >= 0 and now.hour < 6:
    return "night"
  elif now.hour >= 6 and now.hour < 12:
    return "morning"
  elif now.hour >= 12 and now.hour < 18:
    return "afternoon"

  return "evening"
```

---

```python, [.highlight: 2]
def get_time_of_day():
  now = datetime.now()

  if now.hour >= 0 and now.hour < 6:
    return "night"
  elif now.hour >= 6 and now.hour < 12:
    return "morning"
  elif now.hour >= 12 and now.hour < 18:
    return "afternoon"

  return "evening"
```

---

> How can we resolve this issue?
-- 🧙‍♂️

---

```python, [.highlight: 2]


def get_time_of_day(datetime):
  if datetime.hour >= 0 and datetime.hour < 6:
    return "night"
  elif datetime.hour >= 6 and datetime.hour < 12:
    return "morning"
  elif datetime.hour >= 12 and datetime.hour < 18:
    return "afternoon"

  return "evening"
```

---

> Testing is easy now.
-- 🧙‍♂️

---

```python
def today_at(hour):
  now = datetime.now()

  return datetime(now.year, now.month, now.day, hour)


class TestGetTimeOfDay(unittest.TestCase):
  def test_returns_morning_at_6(self):
    time_of_day = get_time_of_day(today_at(6))

    self.assertEqual(time_of_day, "morning")
```
