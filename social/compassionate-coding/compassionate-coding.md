# Compassionate Coding
### _being more humane in tech_

^
Thank you for being here! My name is Sascha, backend dev/tsa @grandcentrix

^
Disclaimer:
This talk is strongly inspired by the works of April Wensel and her orga "Compassionate Coding"
I'm not affiliated with her orga in any way, rather this is about giving credit and raising awareness!

^
Now that this is out of the way, let's get going!
This talk is about COMMUNICATION

---
![](images/communication.jpg)

^
In brief Communcation revolves around

---
# Communication
### Transfering information from one person to another

^
All our jobs include some form of communication
- Customer contact
- Meetings: Daily/Planning/Review/Retro
- Digital: Jira/Confluence/GitHub/Slack

^
The thing is, we in tech are all about solving problems

---
![](images/problem-solving.jpeg)

^
Solving problems in an efficient manner; we talk a lot about
- Efficent Code
- Time Management
- High Velocity

^
Of course that also means we want to have ...

---
## Efficient
# Communication

^
And for a lot of people that means ...

---
## Brisk & Direct
# Communication

^
In this talk I would like to pose the question, if ...

---
##  Brisk & Direct?
# Communication

^
most efficient way?

---
# Let's start
### _small_

---
![](images/code-reviews.jpeg)

^
Let me ask you a question ...

---
# Who here had a <br/> *negative experience* <br/> in a code review?

![](images/sad.jpeg)

^
hurt; left back a bad feeling/bad taste; didn't feel quite right

^
So what? Some might say ...

---
> People need a thicker skin!
-- Somebody

---
> It's not my job to care about others feelings!
-- Somebody

---
> That's the way tech works!
-- Somebody

^
I user to think like that!

---
> What now? I'm no longer allowed to criticise people?
-- Somebody

^
No, that's not what I'm saying, I'm here to present an alternative:

---
# What if I told you <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> There is an *alternative*

![](images/what-if-I-told-you.jpg)

---
# Compassion

![](images/compassion.jpeg)

^
it is defined as the feeling that arises when you are confronted with another’s suffering and feel motivated to relieve that suffering.

^
How might that look like?

---
# How about some examples?

^
I went through my own personal history of code reviews(images/code-reviews.jpeg)

---
## I'm gonna eat my own dogfoot

---
# Passing of Opinion as Fact

---
# Passing of Opinion as Fact[^1]

^
What's the problem with this?

^
No backup (docs, guidelines etc.). Personal preference is not enough!

^
How might an alternative look like?

---
# Compassionate Alternative

> The Phoenix docs suggest to move persistence related functionality into a so called "Context" ([see here](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/contexts.html)). I think that's applicable here and would improve the project structure. What do you think?
-- A better me

^
Better!
- Links to docs
- Explains why
- Asks for feedback

---
# Asking judgmental questions

---
# Asking judgmental questions[^1]

<br/><br/><br/>

![inline](images/reviews/why-not-use.png)

^
Implies solution should be obvious => Person is dumb to not see it

^
Veiled demands => Instead provide recommandations (links)

---
# Compassionate Alternative

> You could move this into a view, which has the benefit of separating the "response building" from the "rendering" logic.
-- A better me

^
There are other, would be too much for this talk ...

^
Some of you might ask yourself: Why should I care?

---
# [fit] `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

^
That's certainly a valid question! Why should we?

^
Because it leads to better collaboration

---

~5 minutes
Ask youself: Which of the comments above would have had more of an impact on you?

^
Not convinced? In 2012 Google embarked on journey to answer the following question ...

---
> What's the secret to <br/> a successful team?
-- Project Aristotle

^
2 years of research
- 200+ interviews with Googlers
- from 180+ active Google teams
- looked at 250 different attributes

---
# Psychological Safety[^2]

[^2]: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html

---
# Psychological Safety

> [the] shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking. [...]
> A sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up.
-- Amy Edmondson (Harvard Business School)

^
What does that mean?
- A protected environment for ideas and exchange
- Healthy culture around failure
- A lot more things, check the article out!

^
One way of approaching this is COMPASSION

---
![](images/run-away.jpeg)

^
Try to avoid triggering the others thread response
- You can handle criticism? Great! Others might not!
- Reiterate: Critic is okay but consider the other!

^
Quote April Wensel: Compassion != "ruinous empathy"

^
Next: What now?

---
![](images/rainbow.gif)

^
Be more compassionate in code reviews and all problems are fixed?

^
Compassion in Code Reviews = Profit? No

---
## Of course
# Code Reviews
## are just a small part

---
## But they are a
# great start

^
Now that you might have an impression why these ideas are important ...

---
## Let's go
# [fit] _big_

^
And by that I mean, let's talk about ...

---
# The Tech Industry

^
At large ...
Because you see, right now ...

---
## We in the tech industry value
# intelligence

---
### We talk about
# ROCKSTAR DEVS
### and
# CODE NINJAS

---
## We make fun of
# "untechnical" people

^
Things like: "The customer requested the source code in a PDF!"

^
It IS pretty funny but we should keep one thing in mind ...

---
## But what does
# *technical*
## actually mean?

^
I looked it up on Wiktionary and this is what came out of it

---
# Technical

> Of or pertaining to the useful or mechanic arts, or to any academic, legal, science, engineering, business, or the like terminology with specific and precise meaning or (frequently, as a degree of distinction) shades of meaning; specially appropriate to any art, science or engineering field, or business
-- Wiktionary

^
I'll just gonna let you read it

---
![](images/wat.jpg)

^
Maybe let's use some examples

---
## Maybe some examples are better ...

---
[.build-lists: true]

# Technical Examples

- Programming Python
- Using Photoshop
- Accounting in Excel
- Dancing Disco Fox
- Using a Fork

^
Sooo ...

---

# Technical Examples

- Programming Python
- Using Photoshop
- Accounting in Excel
- Dancing Disco Fox
- Using a Fork

<br/>__Pretty much any learned skill__

^
Also ...

---
## Being
# technical & intelligent
## isn't everything

![](images/technical.jpeg)

---
## Being
# compassionate
## counts too

![](images/compassion.jpeg)

^
So that we can create ...

---
# Psychological Safety[^2]

^
For ...
- Better Teams
- Efficient Communication

^
I want to close this talk with a quote from the person who inspired me to do this:

---
# Be the change ❤️

> The tech industry — and the world — is made up of individual humans, and a lot of those humans are suffering. Each of us has the opportunity to do something about it.
